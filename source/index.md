# Hello, World

Welcome to the __unofficial__ site of the Computer Science department at the University of Florida! This unofficial site is here to provide a bridge between the UF CISE community and current (or potential!) UF CISE students. Hopefully, this site will grow into a collection of student projects, organizations, and class suggestions/comments/resources.

If you'd like to contribute, check out the source at [https://github.com/ufcise/ufcise.github.io](https://github.com/ufcise/ufcise.github.io) and submit a pull request. If you're not really sure how to do that, but still want to contribute, send an email to [Andrew Kerr](mailto: me+ufcise@andrewjkerr).

## Resources

UF CISE has _plenty_ of resources. On the internet, we've got:

- A [Facebook group*](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uf.compsci/) where students can ask questions about classes, comment about current events, or share a cool project they've worked on.
- Another [Facebook group*](https://www.facebook.com/groups/uf.compsci.classifieds/) for those seeking potential internships or looking to sell/buy _relevant_ items (textbooks, required course equipment, etc).
- A [Slack organization*](https://ufcise.slack.com) in which students can chat with each other about relevant topics.
- The [official UF CISE resources](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/help) page.

(* `@ufl.edu` email address required!)

And, in person, we have:

- [UF ACM](http://acm.cise.ufl.edu/) which is a fabulous organization which is willing to help students with class recommendations, finding resources, and more!
- [UF CISE Tutoring](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/academics/tutoring) which is completely free!

I'm definitely missing a few, so make sure to submit a PR if you'd like to add anything!
