# ufcise.github.io
Unofficial site for UF CISE maintained by the UF CISE community. Powered by Middleman.

## To-do:

- [x] Social media info
- [ ] Student organization list/info
- [ ] Specific class list/info
- [ ] Anything else?

## Organization

This repository is split into two main branches - source and master. Master contains the static code for the site (which is published) and source contains, well, the source.

## Run Locally

Want to run this locally? Sure. Go for it.

1. Clone this repository
2. `bundle install`
3. `middleman`

Boom! Easy, right?

## Old README (or, the site philosophy!)

Actually not officially UF CISE.

I'm thinking more of an "unofficial" updated source for things happening around the college. Not (mostly) job related like the official UF CISE blog, but more of "hey, this org is having an event today" or "these orgs meet on xx at yy".

And, well, a CISE student showcase of course.

No site here yet, will work on eventually - unless someone already has a sick site design they wouldn't mind contributing. (By sick, I mean something that looks and performs nicely.)
